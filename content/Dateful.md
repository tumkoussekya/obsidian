3. Your script converts and displays it in the target zone
    
    - Example:
        
        js
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `import { DateTime } from 'luxon';  const fromZone = 'America/New_York'; const toZone = 'Asia/Tokyo';  const originalTime = DateTime.fromObject(   { year: 2025, month: 5, day: 19, hour: 15 },   { zone: fromZone } );  const converted = originalTime.setZone(toZone).toFormat('yyyy LLL dd, hh:mm a'); console.log(converted); // → 2025 May 20, 04:00 AM`

Let me know your audience or user goals (e.g., travel, remote teams, fun tools, pro features), and I can recommend the **best next step** and even help prototype it with you.

Would you like a shortlist of the **top 5 features** to add next based on your current progress?

##### You said:

i am hindu , why i add the things for the islam

###### ChatGPT said:

That’s a fair question — and a good one.

Here’s the honest perspective:

You don’t _have_ to include Islamic-specific features (or any religious features) in your app, especially if you’re targeting a general or secular audience. However, the reason I suggested it — along with other religious tools — is because **time and date tools are often used for religious observance** across cultures, not just one.

Since you're Hindu, you might prefer to focus on features relevant to your tradition or audience. So here are **culturally relevant time-based features** you could add for **Hindu users**, or broader Indian audiences:

---

## 🇮🇳 Hindu / Indian Time Tools You Could Build

### 🕉️ 1. **Panchang Calendar Integration**

> Shows daily **tithi**, **nakshatra**, **yoga**, **karana**, **sunrise/sunset**, **rahukalam**, etc.

- Users can check auspicious timings (muhurats)
    
- Localized by city and date
    
- Could integrate with an API like [Drik Panchang](https://www.drikpanchang.com/) or build it custom
    

---

### 🌙 2. **Festival Date Tracker**

> List of major Hindu festivals (Diwali, Navratri, Holi, etc.)

- With dates in Gregorian and Vikram Samvat calendars
    
- Show countdowns or alerts for upcoming ones
    

---

### 🔔 3. **Muhurta Finder**

> Find auspicious dates/times for:

- Marriage, housewarming (griha pravesh), naming, etc.
    
- Customizable based on location and user’s preferences
    

---

### 📿 4. **Choghadiya Calculator**

> Shows good/bad time periods during the day for starting tasks

- Based on sunrise/sunset of the user's location

### 🕯️ 5. **Sunrise, Sunset & Sandhya Times**

> Display exact times for:

### 📆 6. **Vikram Samvat / Shaka Samvat Converter**

> Convert between Western (Gregorian) and Indian traditional calendars

---

## 🧠 Why Include These?

- You're building a time/date tool — and **time has deep meaning in Hindu culture**
    
- These features serve **real needs** for puja, rituals, and life events
    
- You’ll make your tool more valuable to **millions of users in India and abroad**
    

---

### 👣 Final Word

So to be clear:  
You don't need to build Islamic or Christian tools unless you're serving those users.  
**But including features for any group — Hindu, Muslim, Christian, or secular — should depend on your vision and your audience.**

If your audience is mostly Indian or Hindu, you have a great opportunity to make tools that reflect that.

Let me know if you'd like help designing a **Panchang tool**, **festival calendar**, or **Choghadiya calculator** — I can help you build any of those.

### 🔥 Final Advice

If you're building this for:

#### ✅ **A Portfolio**

Pick 8–10 of the best features (don't build all 60 unless you want to make it a long-term product). Focus on:

- Strong UI/UX
    
- Clean code
    
- Responsive design
    
- Cool touches (drag & drop clocks, shareable links)
    

#### ✅ **A Product**

- Focus on a niche audience (e.g., remote teams, Indian users)
    
- Add a user system (account, save clocks/events)
    
- Build API access for developers
    
- Monetize premium features or customizations
