There were multiple AI agents in the market and make an impact into the market.
So How can i get into this field and make a Difference.
I Like some of the industry that has to completely depend upon the AI and New technology and the Most important Field is Education.


And so i have a idea about creating a Schooling System from Std 1 to Std 12 and then Undergraduate Course  , Post Graduate Course as well as PhD , Post Doctoral Program.

Which has the Each and Every Concept that has to learn by any Student as a compulsory like 4 languages are must to learn any person. 
1. Mother Tongue Language
2. National Language of their country
3. One International Language
4. English irrespective of their field because IT is the most easiest method to communicate with any computer device.

In my case my 4 languages are
1. Gujarati
2. Hindi
3. English
4. Sanskrit

This can make person thinking ability more strong and make their mind to learn more and more thing , without any language barrier.

See in my case My mother-tongue is Gujarati , so i can speak-write-think-understand in this language which can make my communication skill better because i can easily talk with my surrounding and understand their issue , which can make my personality better , define my profile and impression between them.

Hindi is my national language as i live in india , it is the most spoken language in the this country , so whenever i am travelling from gujarat to any other state, i can communicate with other people and can talk with them and my work can be done without any language barrier.

I am a computer undergrad student , so English is the my only supportive language to work with my computer and write a code in any of the programming language.

I learnt the sanskrit in my school , which can help me to read and understand our ancient books and i can grasp the knowledge regarding the ancient time like The time of ramayana , I can read and understand the shlokas of the geeta , mahabharat which can give us the idea regarding how to overcome from the stress, what is life , how can we live peacefully and happy with our family.


This is the One part regarding the language.

Another field is teaching student about the Science , Mathematics , Arts as a compulsory subject with implementation of AI , ML , Visual presentation , AR/VR for more perspective depth of the subject.

Each and every subject is beautiful , but we have to change the medium of lecture delivery , like
mathematics can be teach with the help of coding , visual graphs and animation , which can clear the idea regarding the Concept , where we can implement this topic in real-life and what can you do with this?

Science is the subject which can teach with the help of practical and theory combination.
But reading and understanding the theory of Science is very tough for many student , so the same idea of visual presentation can be helpful for students , they have to setup the different clubs regarding science which can help them to learn beyond the book , make sure they are actively participating in the different Olympiads programs and can go into the science field.

Social Science is the subject which has to be learn by each and every student, it can aware student about their social and political roles , how they have to act , what are their responsibilities , what are their moral values, how they have to follow rules and how to be a nice person and inspiration for other.


coding is the must learn thing in this current scenario. now in this era of AI and LLMs, Everyone should learn AI and coding so that they can make their idea into the reality , they can experiment into the different field and can make their memory sharp.

Finance is the topic which has to be learn by everyone , as of the market is growing rapidly , the inflation rate is continuously  increasing , that how can we have to use the money , invest the money and how can we further by the things with that money and make it safe.
