    - Signal processing (EEG, EMG).
    - Neuroscience basics, neural signal decoding.
    - AI for interpreting brain signals.
- **What you learn**: How to interface brain signals with machines for applications like medical devices or communication aids for those with disabilities.
- **Focus**: Creating interfaces that allow people to control devices using brain activity.

### **10. Machine Consciousness (MCI)**

- **Why Last**: **MCI** is the most speculative and philosophical area of AI, concerned with whether machines could ever exhibit consciousness similar to humans.
- **Key Skills**:
    - Cognitive science, philosophy of mind, ethics of AI.
    - Advanced understanding of **AGI** (Artificial General Intelligence) and **sentience**.
- **Tools**: Theoretical work (no specific tools).
- **What you learn**: You explore the ethical, philosophical, and cognitive aspects of creating self-aware machines.
- **Focus**: This is more of a research-oriented area that explores **machine consciousness** and whether AI systems could eventually become conscious.
