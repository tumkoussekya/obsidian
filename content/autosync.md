i am using the obsidian from a very long time and it has one issue regarding its multiplatform content sharing.
is there any way you have that can help me to access the notes in the computer is accessible into the my phone without any distrubance.
and also vice versa
ChatGPT said:
Obsidian is a fantastic note-taking tool, but when it comes to seamless multiplatform syncing between your computer and phone, it does have its challenges, especially when it comes to sharing content across devices.

Luckily, there are a few ways to sync your notes between devices, ensuring that your content is always up to date, whether you're using your computer or phone. Here are a few methods you can try:

1. Obsidian Sync (Paid Option)
Obsidian offers a Sync service which is a cloud-based solution specifically designed for syncing your notes across devices. With Obsidian Sync, your notes will be synced in real time between your phone and computer (and other devices) with no hassle. This method works seamlessly for users who are willing to pay for the service.

Pros:

Direct integration into Obsidian.

Real-time sync across all devices.

End-to-end encryption.

Cons:

Paid subscription (though it’s relatively affordable compared to some other syncing solutions).

How to Set Up:

Go to Settings > Sync in Obsidian.

Sign in or create an account.

Enable the sync for your vault.

2. Third-Party Cloud Services (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.)
If you prefer a free solution and are comfortable using third-party cloud services, you can sync your Obsidian vault using Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive.

How to Set Up:

On Your Computer:

Move your Obsidian vault folder to a synced cloud directory (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive).

On Your Phone:

Use the Obsidian mobile app and open the vault from the cloud folder (you may need the Obsidian mobile app for this).

You may need a third-party app to manage cloud services, such as the Google Drive or Dropbox apps to access your files.

Pros:

Free (or a low-cost paid plan for extra storage).

More control over storage.

Cons:

May require extra steps for seamless integration (e.g., cloud app).

Sync could be slower or less reliable than Obsidian Sync.

3. Git-Based Sync (Advanced Option)
For advanced users, Git can be used to sync your vault across devices. You would push changes to a Git repository, and pull them onto your other device.

How to Set Up:

Create a private Git repository on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

Use a Git client to push and pull changes between your computer and phone.

On your mobile device, use an app like Working Copy (iOS) to sync the vault.

Pros:

Completely free.

Provides version control for your notes.

Cons:

Requires some technical knowledge.

Not as user-friendly as the other methods.

4. Obsidian Web Clipper (for Quick Access)
If you don’t mind manually syncing some content, you can use the Obsidian Web Clipper to quickly grab notes from your computer browser and access them on your phone.

Pros:

Quick for occasional use.

Cons:

Not a full syncing solution.

Manual steps involved.

Best Solution:
Obsidian Sync is the most seamless and user-friendly method for syncing between devices. If you don’t mind the paid subscription, this would be the easiest and most hassle-free way.

Cloud Services like Google Drive or Dropbox can be an effective free alternative if you don't want to subscribe to Obsidian Sync.

Git is great if you are comfortable with a bit of technical setup.

Which option works best for you depends on how comfortable you are with cloud services or if you're looking for a fully integrated solution from Obsidian.

i also think about the git 
the all the notes are storede into the md files and the folder i know , then can you give me some ci/cd code that can i paste into the .yaml files and after saving any content it automatically uploaded into the github repository and if any type of theme is required then also give it 
ChatGPT said:
Great choice! Git is a powerful and flexible way to sync your Obsidian vault across devices. Setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically upload your notes to a GitHub repository when changes are made can be done using GitHub Actions.

Here’s how you can set up a GitHub Action to automatically push changes from your local Obsidian vault to a GitHub repository.

Steps:
Create a GitHub Repository:

First, create a repository on GitHub where you want to store your notes. You can either use an existing one or create a new repository.

Set Up Your Local Vault with Git:

Initialize a Git repository inside your Obsidian vault if you haven’t already:

cd /path/to/your/obsidian-vault
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master
Create a GitHub Action:

Now, you can set up GitHub Actions to automate the process. In your GitHub repository, create a .github/workflows folder if it doesn't already exist.

Create the .yaml Workflow File:

In the .github/workflows folder, create a file named sync.yml (or any name you prefer) to define your CI/CD pipeline.

Here’s an example of a CI/CD pipeline that will automatically push changes whenever you update your vault (e.g., from your computer or mobile device using Git):

name: Sync Obsidian Vault

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master   # or main, depending on your default branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master   # or main, depending on your default branch

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # This ensures full history is available

      # Step 2: Set up Git
      - name: Set up Git
        run: |
          git config --global user.name "your-github-username"
          git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
          
      # Step 3: Add and commit changes
      - name: Commit changes if any
        run: |
          git add .
          git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "Auto commit: Update notes"
          
      # Step 4: Push changes to GitHub
      - name: Push changes
        run: |
          git push origin master  # Push changes to the repository
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
Explanation of the Workflow:
on.push: This trigger starts the workflow whenever there’s a push to the specified branch (in this case, master or main). You could also add more triggers based on your needs.

actions/checkout@v3: This action checks out your GitHub repository.

Git setup: It configures your Git username and email for commits.

Commit changes: The script stages and commits changes if any are present.

Push changes: This step pushes the committed changes back to the GitHub repository. It uses the GITHUB_TOKEN for authentication.

GitHub Token:
GitHub automatically provides a token called GITHUB_TOKEN to authenticate actions when you run workflows. This is used in the Push changes step.

Automating on Your Local Computer:
To automate this process for your local computer, you can use a cron job or Git hooks to regularly pull from GitHub and push changes to your repository whenever a modification is made. However, since GitHub Actions will do the job of pushing changes to GitHub whenever you push to the repository, you will just need to make sure you’ve committed and pushed your changes locally on your phone or computer.

Optional Theme:
If you want to set a specific theme for your Obsidian vault or trigger it in your CI/CD pipeline, you can manually install and manage themes by including them in your repository (under a .obsidian/themes folder, for example). GitHub Actions doesn't directly control Obsidian's themes, but it will sync the changes of your .obsidian folder if it's part of the repository.

Example of Syncing Theme:
Make sure your theme is in your .obsidian/themes/ folder.

Push that folder along with your notes, and it will be available across devices after syncing.

Local Setup (Optional):
On your local device, make sure you are regularly pulling from the repository (especially if you make changes on other devices), and always commit and push your changes.

You could add a cron job or script to your computer that automatically does a git pull and git push periodically to keep everything in sync.

Final Setup:
After everything is set up, every time you make a change to your Obsidian notes (either on your phone or computer), you just need to commit those changes and push them. The GitHub Actions workflow will handle the automatic syncing.

i dont have any kowledege regarding the CI/CD , i am directly usage the vercel in my other projects , so i dont know anything regarding this tools and how to do
ChatGPT said:
No worries! Since you're already using Vercel for other projects, you're already familiar with deploying and automating things to some extent. However, CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions are a bit different from what Vercel does, but they can be just as useful for automating tasks like syncing your Obsidian vault.

Let's break it down step-by-step with simple instructions and without diving too deep into technical jargon. I’ll guide you through setting up a GitHub Action for syncing your Obsidian vault using GitHub and GitHub Actions.

What You Need
GitHub account (you probably already have one if you're using Vercel).

A GitHub repository where your Obsidian vault (your notes) will live.

Basic Git knowledge (I’ll help with that too).

Step 1: Set Up a GitHub Repository for Your Notes
First, you need a place to store your notes. This is a GitHub repository.

Go to GitHub.

Click the + icon in the upper-right corner and select New repository.

Name your repository something like obsidian-vault and make it public or private, depending on your preference.

Create the repository.

Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Obsidian Vault
Now, you need to link your Obsidian vault (the folder where you store your notes) with the GitHub repository you just created.

Open your Obsidian vault (where your notes are).

Open a terminal (or Command Prompt) in that folder.

If you're on Windows, you can use Git Bash or PowerShell. On macOS/Linux, you can use the built-in terminal.

Run these commands to initialize Git and link your Obsidian vault with your GitHub repository:

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/obsidian-vault.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master
Replace your-username with your GitHub username.

After this, your Obsidian vault should be connected to GitHub.

Step 3: Set Up GitHub Actions for Automatic Sync
Now we’ll create a GitHub Action to automatically push any changes you make in your Obsidian vault to GitHub. This is where the CI/CD magic happens.

Inside your GitHub repository (obsidian-vault), you’ll need to create a workflow for the GitHub Action.

In your GitHub repository:

Go to the Code tab.

In the file list, create a folder called .github (if it doesn't already exist).

Inside that folder, create another folder called workflows.

Inside the workflows folder, create a new file named sync.yml.

Add this YAML code to sync.yml (you can copy-paste it):

name: Sync Obsidian Vault

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master   # or main, depending on your default branch

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      # Step 2: Set up Git
      - name: Set up Git
        run: |
          git config --global user.name "your-github-username"
          git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
          
      # Step 3: Commit changes if any
      - name: Commit changes if any
        run: |
          git add .
          git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "Auto commit: Update notes"
          
      # Step 4: Push changes
      - name: Push changes
        run: |
          git push origin master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
What this does:

It listens for any changes (pushes) to the master (or main) branch.

It checks the repository for changes.

It commits any changes to your Obsidian vault (if there are any) and pushes them back to GitHub.

Step 4: Commit the Changes and Push
Once you've added the sync.yml file to your repository, commit the file to your GitHub repository. This will trigger the GitHub Action to start running.

In your terminal (inside the Obsidian vault folder), run:

git add .github/
git commit -m "Set up GitHub Action to sync Obsidian notes"
git push
Step 5: Syncing Your Notes with GitHub
Now that everything is set up:

When you make changes to your Obsidian vault (add notes, modify notes, etc.), commit the changes as you normally would:

git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
GitHub Actions will automatically sync your vault to GitHub every time you push to the repository.

Final Thoughts
GitHub Actions will run automatically on any git push you make to GitHub. This will ensure your notes are always backed up and synchronized.

You can also use this method on your phone, as long as you have access to a Git client and can push changes.

You can check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository to see the status of the workflows.

If any of these steps are unclear or you want help with the GitHub Actions part, feel free to let me know! I can assist you in tweaking the steps or explaining in more detail.

You said:
but i want to see all this into the any website form , not like this in direct github
ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see! You want to have a website that automatically displays your Obsidian notes, rather than just syncing them to GitHub for version control. This way, you'll be able to view and share your notes on a live website, rather than just in GitHub. You can achieve this by deploying your notes to a website automatically.

Here’s how you can do that:

Step 1: Set Up a Static Site Generator
To display your Obsidian notes as a website, you'll need to convert your markdown files (.md) into HTML files. There are several static site generators (SSGs) that can take your markdown files and convert them into a beautiful website. Jekyll and Hugo are two of the most popular ones.

Since you're already using Vercel, we can set up a Jekyll or Hugo site that automatically deploys every time you update your Obsidian notes.

Step 2: Convert Your Obsidian Notes to a Static Site
Option 1: Using Jekyll
Jekyll is a popular static site generator that can take your markdown files and convert them into a website.

Install Jekyll (If you're on macOS or Linux, you can follow these instructions: Jekyll Installation Guide).

Create a Jekyll Site:

Navigate to your Obsidian vault folder in the terminal.

Initialize a Jekyll site:

jekyll new my-notes-site
cd my-notes-site
Move your .md files from your Obsidian vault to the _posts folder of your Jekyll site.

Update the _config.yml file for Jekyll to make it fit with your style and needs.

Test the site locally by running:

bundle exec jekyll serve
Deploy to GitHub Pages:

After testing locally, you can deploy your Jekyll site to GitHub Pages or Vercel.

Option 2: Using Hugo
Hugo is another static site generator that works similarly to Jekyll. It’s faster and also great for markdown-to-HTML conversion.

Install Hugo: Install Hugo following the Hugo installation guide.

Create a New Hugo Site:

In your terminal, navigate to your Obsidian vault folder and create a new Hugo site:

hugo new site my-notes-site
cd my-notes-site
Copy your .md files from the Obsidian vault into the content folder of your Hugo site.

Test the site locally by running:

hugo server
Deploy to Vercel:

Once you’re happy with how the site looks locally, you can deploy it to Vercel. This is super easy if you’re familiar with Vercel:

Push your site to a GitHub repository.

Link the repository to Vercel.

Vercel will automatically deploy the site and give you a URL.

Step 3: Set Up GitHub Actions for Automated Sync
To automate the process of converting your Obsidian notes into a static website, you can use GitHub Actions. You’ll push updates to GitHub, and the site will automatically be rebuilt and redeployed.

Here’s how you can set up GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your site to Vercel whenever you make a change in your notes:

Create a GitHub Repository for your Hugo or Jekyll site (if you don’t already have one).

Push your Hugo/Jekyll site to the GitHub repository.

In the .github/workflows directory, create a file like deploy.yml to automate the deployment.

Example of a GitHub Actions deployment workflow for Hugo:

name: Deploy Hugo Site

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master  # Change to main if you are using the main branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Install Hugo
      - name: Install Hugo
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install hugo

      # Build the Hugo site
      - name: Build site
        run: hugo

      # Deploy to Vercel
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
For Vercel, you need to create a Vercel account and get the following details from your Vercel project:

VERCEL_TOKEN

VERCEL_PROJECT_ID

VERCEL_ORG_ID

These values need to be saved in GitHub Secrets so they are securely available during deployment.

Step 4: Sync Your Notes Automatically
Once everything is set up, you can:

Push your Obsidian vault changes to GitHub, which will trigger the GitHub Actions to build and deploy your website.

Every time you make a change in your Obsidian vault and push it to GitHub, the website will automatically update.

Step 5: Access Your Notes on a Website
After deployment, your Obsidian notes will be accessible on a live website that you can access from any device.

On Vercel, you will be given a URL like https://my-notes-site.vercel.app/, and your notes will be accessible there as a full website.

You can easily share this link with others or keep it private.

Quick Summary:
Set up a Static Site Generator like Jekyll or Hugo to convert your Obsidian markdown notes into a website.

Push your site to GitHub.

Use GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy your site to Vercel.

View your notes on a website!

This setup will give you a website that reflects your Obsidian notes, and every time you update your notes and push to GitHub, the website will automatically update too.

im using the windows 11
ChatGPT said:
No problem! If you're using Windows 11, the steps will be slightly adjusted for the Windows environment. I'll guide you through everything step-by-step, from setting up your static site (using Hugo or Jekyll) to deploying it using GitHub Actions and Vercel.

Step 1: Install Hugo or Jekyll on Windows 11
You can choose between Hugo and Jekyll, but I’ll walk you through setting up Hugo, which is a faster and simpler tool for creating static sites. If you prefer Jekyll, I can guide you through that instead.

Install Hugo on Windows 11:
Download Hugo from the official website:

Go to the Hugo Releases Page.

Download the Windows version (e.g., hugo_0.112.5_windows-amd64.zip).

Extract the downloaded file:

Right-click on the .zip file and choose Extract All.

After extraction, you’ll have a folder with the Hugo executable.

Add Hugo to your PATH:

Press Win + X and select System.

Click on Advanced system settings > Environment Variables.

Under System variables, scroll down to Path and click Edit.

Click New and paste the path to the folder where hugo.exe is located (the folder where you extracted Hugo).

Click OK to save the changes.

Verify Hugo installation:

Open Command Prompt (press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter).

Type hugo version and press Enter.

If installed correctly, it will show the version of Hugo installed.

Step 2: Create a Hugo Site and Add Your Obsidian Notes
Create a new Hugo site:

Open Command Prompt and navigate to the folder where you want to create your Hugo site (e.g., your Obsidian vault directory).

Run the following command to create a new Hugo site:

hugo new site my-notes-site
cd my-notes-site
Copy your Obsidian notes:

Copy your .md files from your Obsidian vault to the content folder in your new Hugo site directory.

Choose a Hugo theme (optional):

Hugo has many themes you can use. Go to Hugo Themes and choose one that you like.

Follow the instructions on the theme’s page to install it in your site.

Test the site locally:

After copying your notes and setting up a theme, you can test the site locally.

In the Hugo site directory, run:

hugo server
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:1313/ to see your site in action.

Step 3: Set Up GitHub and Deploy Your Site to Vercel
You now have a static Hugo site ready. Let’s set it up to deploy automatically to GitHub and then link it to Vercel.

1. Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and log in to your account.

Click the + button in the upper-right corner and select New Repository.

Name your repository (e.g., obsidian-vault) and click Create Repository.

2. Push Your Hugo Site to GitHub
Open Command Prompt in your Hugo site directory (if you’re not already there).

Run the following commands to initialize Git and push your Hugo site to GitHub:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of Hugo site"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
git push -u origin master
Replace your-username with your GitHub username and your-repository-name with the name of the repository you just created.

3. Link Your GitHub Repository to Vercel
Go to Vercel and log in with your GitHub account.

Click the New Project button.

Import your GitHub repository (it should automatically appear once linked to your GitHub account).

Vercel will automatically detect it’s a Hugo project. Click Deploy to deploy your site.

After a few moments, you’ll get a Vercel URL (e.g., https://your-notes-site.vercel.app/) where your Hugo site will be live!

Step 4: Set Up GitHub Actions for Automatic Sync
Now, let’s automate the process of pushing your changes to GitHub and Vercel using GitHub Actions.

Inside your GitHub repository, create the following folder structure:

.github/workflows

Inside .github/workflows, create a new file called deploy.yml and add the following code:

name: Deploy Hugo Site

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master  # or main, depending on your default branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Install Hugo
      - name: Install Hugo
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install hugo

      # Build the Hugo site
      - name: Build site
        run: hugo

      # Deploy to Vercel
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
GitHub Secrets:
Before GitHub Actions can deploy your site to Vercel, you'll need to add some secrets to your repository:

Go to your GitHub repository.

Click on Settings > Secrets > New repository secret.

Add the following secrets:

VERCEL_TOKEN: Get this from your Vercel Dashboard.

VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: Find this in your Vercel project settings.

VERCEL_ORG_ID: Also in your Vercel project settings.

Step 5: Deploying and Syncing
Push changes to GitHub:

Every time you make a change in your Obsidian vault and commit it to GitHub, GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the deployment process to Vercel.

Run these commands to commit any new changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Updated notes"
git push
Your site will be updated:

GitHub Actions will automatically rebuild your Hugo site and deploy it to Vercel.

Final Thoughts
You now have a fully automated workflow that:

Takes your Obsidian notes (markdown files).

Converts them to a static website using Hugo.

Deploys it automatically to Vercel using GitHub Actions.

Makes it available as a live website.

You can now access your notes as a website, and every time you push new changes to your GitHub repository, it will be updated on the live site!

Let me know if you need more clarification on any of these steps!

You said:
use Jekyll, 
ChatGPT said:
Got it! Let’s switch to Jekyll for your static site generator, and I'll guide you through setting everything up for Windows 11.

Here's the plan:

Install Jekyll on Windows 11.

Create a Jekyll site from your Obsidian notes.

Push the site to GitHub and set up GitHub Actions to automatically deploy it to Vercel.

Step 1: Install Jekyll on Windows 11
Prerequisites
Before installing Jekyll, you'll need to install a few tools:

Ruby (since Jekyll is written in Ruby).

Ruby DevKit for Windows.

Git for version control.

Install Ruby:
Go to the RubyInstaller for Windows website.

Download the Ruby+Devkit version (e.g., Ruby 3.x.x (x64)).

Run the installer and ensure to check the option that says Add Ruby to PATH during installation.

After installation, close the installer.

Install Jekyll:
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell (press Win + X, then choose Command Prompt or PowerShell).

Install the necessary gems for Jekyll:

gem install jekyll bundler
This will install Jekyll and Bundler (a dependency manager for Ruby).

Verify Jekyll is installed by typing:

jekyll -v
You should see the Jekyll version if the installation was successful.

Install Git (if not already installed):
Download Git for Windows from Git for Windows.

Run the installer and follow the default steps.

Step 2: Create a Jekyll Site from Your Obsidian Notes
Create a new Jekyll site:
Open Command Prompt and navigate to the folder where you want your Jekyll site to be created (e.g., your Obsidian vault directory).

Run this command to create a new Jekyll site:

jekyll new my-notes-site
cd my-notes-site
Copy your Obsidian notes:

Copy all your Obsidian notes (markdown files) from your Obsidian vault folder to the /_posts directory of your new Jekyll site.

Test your Jekyll site locally:

In the my-notes-site directory, run:

bundle exec jekyll serve
This will build and serve your site locally. You can now open a browser and go to http://localhost:4000/ to see your notes rendered as a website.

Step 3: Push Your Jekyll Site to GitHub
Create a GitHub repository:

Go to GitHub and create a new repository (e.g., obsidian-vault).

Push your Jekyll site to GitHub:
Inside your Jekyll site directory (my-notes-site), run the following commands to initialize Git and push your site to GitHub:

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/obsidian-vault.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of Jekyll site"
git push -u origin master
Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.

Step 4: Deploy the Site to Vercel
Link your GitHub repository to Vercel:

Go to Vercel and log in with your GitHub account.

Click New Project and import your GitHub repository (obsidian-vault).

Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Jekyll project and set up the deployment settings.

Deploy your site:

Vercel will automatically build and deploy your Jekyll site. After the deployment is complete, you will receive a live URL (e.g., https://your-site.vercel.app), where your notes will be available as a website.

Step 5: Set Up GitHub Actions for Continuous Deployment
To make sure your Jekyll site automatically updates every time you push new changes (like when you modify your Obsidian notes), we'll set up GitHub Actions.

Create a .github/workflows folder in your GitHub repository (if it doesn’t already exist).

Create a new file named deploy.yml inside the .github/workflows folder with the following contents:

name: Deploy Jekyll Site

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master  # or main, depending on your default branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Set up Ruby
      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.1'  # You can use the version you installed

      # Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          gem install jekyll bundler
          bundle install

      # Build the site
      - name: Build site
        run: |
          bundle exec jekyll build

      # Deploy to Vercel
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
Set up GitHub Secrets:

Go to your GitHub repository settings.

Under Secrets, click New repository secret and add the following secrets:

VERCEL_TOKEN: Get this from your Vercel Dashboard.

VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: Find this in your Vercel project settings.

VERCEL_ORG_ID: Also in your Vercel project settings.

Step 6: Sync Your Notes Automatically
Whenever you make changes to your Obsidian vault and push them to GitHub, GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the deployment process, rebuilding your Jekyll site and deploying it to Vercel.

Commit your changes:
Every time you update your Obsidian notes, commit them to GitHub:

git add .
git commit -m "Updated Obsidian notes"
git push
GitHub Actions will automatically:

Build the site with Jekyll.

Deploy it to Vercel, and your site will be updated.

Final Thoughts
With this setup, you now have:

A Jekyll-powered static site that converts your Obsidian notes into a live website.

Automatic deployment every time you push changes to GitHub, thanks to GitHub Actions.

A live URL hosted by Vercel to view your notes.

This system keeps your notes easily accessible as a website, and it updates automatically with each change you make in your Obsidian vault.

Great! Now that you've set up your Jekyll-powered website with GitHub Actions and Vercel, there are a few additional steps and enhancements you can explore to improve your experience and make your notes even more accessible. Here are some ideas for what's next:

1. Improve the Site's Design and Navigation
You can customize your Jekyll site to make it visually appealing and easy to navigate. Here are some things to consider:

Customize the Theme: Jekyll has many themes available, or you can even create your own. You can modify the theme's CSS, layout, and templates to make it look the way you want.

Visit Jekyll Themes to find one that suits you.

If you want more customization, you can edit the HTML and CSS directly.

Add a Table of Contents: If you have a large number of notes, adding a table of contents (TOC) or an index page will help organize them better. You can use Jekyll plugins or custom templates to create this.

Search Functionality: Jekyll doesn't have search out of the box, but you can add a search feature with plugins like Jekyll Search. This will make it easier to search through your notes on the live site.

Custom Domain: If you'd like to use a custom domain instead of the Vercel URL (e.g., https://my-notes-site.vercel.app), you can configure it in the Vercel dashboard.

2. Enhance the Workflow with More GitHub Actions
To make your process even more automated and seamless, you can enhance your GitHub Actions workflows:

Automate Versioning: You can add a GitHub Action to automatically increment version numbers every time a change is pushed. This is useful for keeping track of major updates to your notes.

Use a tool like Semantic Versioning to automate version numbering based on commit messages.

Backup to Cloud Storage: Set up another GitHub Action that backs up your notes (in markdown or another format) to a cloud service like Google Drive, Dropbox, or AWS S3 after each deployment.

Email or Slack Notifications: Set up another GitHub Action to send notifications whenever your site is updated (or if something fails during the deployment). For example, you can send a message to your Slack channel or receive an email notification.

3. Add Advanced Features to the Website
Depending on what you need for your notes, here are some advanced features you can add to your Jekyll site:

Tags and Categories: Jekyll supports organizing your posts with tags and categories. This makes it easy to group similar notes or topics together. You can display tags or categories on your site so that visitors can easily filter content.

Commenting System: If you want to allow others to comment on your notes, you can integrate a third-party commenting system like Disqus or Staticman.

PDF Export: You could add a feature to export your notes as PDF files for offline reading. There are various ways to achieve this, such as using a Jekyll plugin like Jekyll PDF Export.

Add Rich Media: If you have images, videos, or other media you want to share alongside your notes, you can embed them directly in your Jekyll posts. You can even integrate with services like YouTube for video embeds or Flickr for image galleries.

4. Integrate External Data and APIs
You can expand the scope of your notes website by integrating external data or APIs:

Weather Updates: If your notes are related to a specific geographic location or activity (e.g., travel notes), you could add a live weather widget using an API like OpenWeather.

Google Analytics: Set up Google Analytics or another analytics tool to monitor traffic on your site. This can help you understand how visitors are interacting with your notes and identify areas for improvement.

Calendar Integration: If you’re writing notes about events or scheduling, you could integrate Google Calendar or Eventbrite to display upcoming events directly on your site.

5. Optimize for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
Even though this is a personal notes site, if you'd like to share your notes publicly or improve their visibility, you can focus on SEO:

Meta Tags: Jekyll allows you to easily add meta tags for SEO. You can customize the <title>, <meta description>, and other SEO-related tags on each page or post.

Optimize Page Speed: Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to analyze your website’s load times and get suggestions for optimization. Compressing images, using caching, and minimizing CSS/JS files can make a big difference.

Sitemap: Create a sitemap.xml for your Jekyll site to help search engines index your pages more effectively. You can use a plugin like Jekyll Sitemap to do this automatically.

6. Use GitHub Pages for Hosting (Optional)
If you prefer using GitHub Pages for hosting rather than Vercel, you can follow these steps:

Change your repository settings to enable GitHub Pages (in Settings > Pages).

Set the source branch (usually master or main) and folder (/root or /docs).

Push your code to GitHub, and your site will be automatically hosted on https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/.

GitHub Pages is a simple and free way to host Jekyll sites, though it may not offer as many features as Vercel for complex sites.

7. Collaborate and Share Your Notes
Collaborators: If you want others to be able to add, update, or contribute to your notes, you can invite them to collaborate on the GitHub repository.

Public or Private: You can keep your repository private or public, depending on whether you want others to be able to view and fork your notes.

8. Backup and Archive Your Notes
Make sure your notes are safe by setting up regular backups:

You can configure GitHub Actions to automatically back up your notes to a cloud service, such as Google Drive or AWS S3, whenever your repository is updated.

Alternatively, you can use GitHub’s releases to archive specific versions of your notes for future reference.

Final Thoughts
You’ve already created a great foundation by using Jekyll, GitHub Actions, and Vercel to turn your Obsidian notes into a live website. The next steps depend on your needs and interests—whether it's improving the design, adding advanced features, or optimizing the site for better performance.
