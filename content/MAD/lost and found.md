If you're cool with this idea, I’ll:

- Give you the **Backendless database plan**    
- Help you **set up login and CRUD** in Java
- Share simple XML layouts and sample code

Just say the word — and I’ll help you knock this out like pros. 🛠️💯

##### You said:

just we are two in groups but i have to do everything , but is there any idea so that we can display 4-5 screens?

###### ChatGPT said:

Ahh okay, so it’s one of _those_ group projects — where it’s a “group” in name only, and **you’re the team** 😅

No worries. I got you.

## 🎯 Objective:

Build a **project with 4–5 screens** that:

- ✅ Looks like a complete, serious app
    
- ✅ Is simple enough to finish alone
    
- ✅ Uses Backendless (or similar backend)
    
- ✅ Checks all boxes for passing
