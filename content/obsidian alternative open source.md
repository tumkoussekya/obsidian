is obsidian open source?

###### ChatGPT said:

Obsidian **is not open source**.

While Obsidian offers a free version and has a strong plugin ecosystem (many of which _are_ open source), the core application itself is **proprietary software**. The developers (Shida Li and Erica Xu) maintain control over its source code, and it is not publicly available for modification or redistribution.

However, some key points:

- ✅ **Plugins and themes**: Many community plugins and themes are open source and hosted on GitHub.
    
- ✅ **Data ownership**: Your notes are stored in plain Markdown files on your local system, which you fully control.
    
- ❌ **Core app**: The main Obsidian app is closed source.
    

Would you like suggestions for open-source alternatives to Obsidian?

##### You said:

i am in that thought that the obisidian is open source and im free about that FOSS thing

###### ChatGPT said:

That's a really common misconception — you're definitely not alone in thinking Obsidian is FOSS (Free and Open Source Software), especially because:

- It **feels** open due to local Markdown files.
    
- It has a thriving **open plugin ecosystem**.
    
- It’s **free for personal use**, which often gets lumped in with FOSS ideas.
    

But at its core, Obsidian is **closed source**, with a proprietary license — so while you _own your data_, you don’t have the freedom to audit, modify, or redistribute the app itself.

If you're committed to using true FOSS software, here are some **open-source alternatives** to Obsidian that are worth considering:

### ✅ Open Source Alternatives

1. **Logseq**
    
    - Markdown-based with outlining and backlinks.
        
    - Fully open source ([GitHub](https://github.com/logseq/logseq)).
        
    - Similar Zettelkasten and graph-style approach.
        
2. **Joplin**
    
    - More Evernote-like, but supports Markdown.
        
    - Full encryption support.
        
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin).
        
3. **Zettlr**
    
    - Academic-friendly, Markdown editor.
        
    - Zettelkasten-compatible.
        
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr).
        
4. **Trilium Notes**
    
    - Powerful hierarchical note system.
        
    - Heavyweight but open source.
        
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/zadam/trilium).

how can i make it

###### ChatGPT said:

Great question — if you're asking **how to make your own Obsidian-like note app** that's truly **FOSS**, it's definitely doable! Here's a high-level roadmap to get you started, depending on your skills and goals.

---

### 🧱 1. **Define Your Core Features**

Decide what features matter to you. For a basic Obsidian-like experience, you'd likely want:

- Local Markdown file storage
    
- Bidirectional linking (`[[like this]]`)
    
- Tag support (`#tags`)
    
- Graph view (optional but cool)
    
- Search + file explorer
    
- Plugin support (advanced)
    
- Cross-platform (desktop at least)
    

---

### 💻 2. **Choose Your Stack**

Here's a common tech stack for such an app:

|Goal|Tech Options|
|---|---|
|**Frontend**|Electron (like Obsidian), or Tauri (lighter, Rust-based)|
|**UI Framework**|React / Vue / Svelte|
|**Markdown Rendering**|`markdown-it`, `remark`, or `Showdown`|
|**Filesystem Access**|Node.js (Electron) or Rust (Tauri)|
|**Graph View**|`vis.js`, `cytoscape.js`, or `d3.js`|
|**Storage**|Local file system (Markdown) — no database needed|

---

### 🔨 3. **Start Small**

You can begin with a **simple MVP** (Minimum Viable Product):

1. Open a folder of `.md` files.
    
2. Display file list + editor.
    
3. Render links (`[[note]]`) and allow navigation.
    
4. Save changes in place.
    

Then expand to:

- Preview mode
    
- Tag support
    
- Graph view
    
- Plugins
    

---

### 🧑‍💻 4. **Resources & Inspirations**

- Look at open-source projects like [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq), [Zettlr](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr), or [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) (VS Code-based).
    
- GitHub is full of FOSS Markdown editors — you can fork and modify one if starting from scratch feels overwhelming.
    

---

### 🆓 5. **Make It Truly FOSS**

Once it's working:

- Pick a license: MIT, GPL, or Apache 2.0
    
- Publish it on GitHub or Codeberg.
    
- Document it well and invite others to contribute!

Would you like a starter template or example project to build from?

##### You said:

i wanna use the electron + react + tailwind css+ nodejs + cytoscape.js and markdown writing and it should be have to opensoruce database conncetivity and real-time update as well

###### ChatGPT said:

Awesome — you’ve got a clear and solid tech stack! Building an Obsidian-like app with:

- **Electron** (desktop wrapper)
    
- **React** (UI)
    
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)
    
- **Node.js** (backend logic / filesystem)
    
- **Cytoscape.js** (graph view)
    
- **Markdown writing/editing**
    
- **Open-source database connectivity**
    
- **Real-time updates**
    

is totally doable. Let me break it into **concrete building blocks** so you can get started step-by-step.

---

## ✅ Project Plan Overview

### 📦 1. **Set Up the Project Scaffold**

Use [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/) or [Electron + Vite + React](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder) starter template.

- Combine Electron + React via Vite or Webpack
    
- Tailwind can be added with PostCSS config
    

**Tools to use:**

bash

CopyEdit

`npm init electron-app@latest your-app cd your-app # Set up React & Tailwind CSS inside`

---

### 🧠 2. **Markdown Writing & Parsing**

Use:

- `react-markdown` or `markdown-it` to render `.md` files
    
- A simple text editor component (like `react-codemirror` or even a `<textarea>` at first)
    

---

### 🗂️ 3. **Filesystem + Note Management**

- Use Node.js (inside Electron’s main process or preload) to:
    
    - Read and write local `.md` files
        
    - Watch directories (`fs.watch`) for real-time updates
        
- Create a structure to hold “notes” with:
    
    - filename
        
    - content
        
    - backlinks (via link parsing)
        
    - tags
        

---

### 🌐 4. **Real-Time Updates**

- Use **WebSocket** or **EventEmitter** to propagate changes between the renderer and main process.
    
- If multi-device sync is desired, add a backend later (using Supabase, Firebase, or your own Node.js server with WebSocket + Postgres).
    

---

### 🧬 5. **Graph View with Cytoscape.js**

- Parse links like `[[note-title]]` in Markdown
    
- Build a directed graph:
    

js

CopyEdit

`nodes: [{ data: { id: 'note1' } }, ...] edges: [{ data: { source: 'note1', target: 'note2' } }, ...]`

- Render using `cytoscape-react` or direct DOM mount.
    

---

### 🗄️ 6. **Open Source Database Connectivity**

Use **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + Realtime + Auth — FOSS!) or a local DB like SQLite (with `better-sqlite3`).

- Sync notes to DB
    
- Enable optional collaboration
    
- Use row-level security if needed
    

---

### 🔄 7. **Live Collaboration (Optional)**

If you want Google Docs-style editing:

- Use **Y.js** or **Automerge** for CRDT (conflict-free collaborative text editing)
    
- Combine with WebSocket/Socket.io for realtime sync
    

---

### 📝 8. **Open Source It!**

- Host your code on GitHub / Codeberg
    
- Add a FOSS license (MIT, GPLv3, etc.)
    
- Write a README and roadmap
    

---

### 🧪 9. **Test & Build**

- Use `electron-builder` to package
    
- Distribute for Linux, macOS, Windows
    

---

## ✅ You Now Have an MVP Plan

If you like, I can help you:

- Scaffold the initial Electron + React + Tailwind app
    
- Write a file system module
    
- Parse `[[wikilinks]]` and visualize with Cytoscape
    

Would you like me to generate a starter project structure with file and folder suggestions?
